Assignment:
If a string has n letters, then the number of permutations is given by the factorial function:

    *n! = 1 x 2 x 3 x ... x n

For example, 3! = 1 x 2 x 3 = 6 and there are six permutations of the three-character string "eat". Implement a recursive factorial function, using the definitions

    *n! = (n - 1)! x n
    *
    *0! = 1

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

/**
   Calculates factorial recursively.
   @param n the number for which to calculate n!
   @return n!, the factorial of n
*/
int factorial(int n) { 

   // TODO
   
   // Remember to use recursion

}

int main() {
   /* 
   Print Expected, "Enter a number: " 
   
   Remember to allow users to input and end line
   */
   
   /*
   Print Expected,
   
   "The factorial of that number is: " (print result here)
   
   To print result just call the function with param of the input number

   return 0;
